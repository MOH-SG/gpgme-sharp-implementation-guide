Intro
=====
This project provides a console program and a reusable code library for encrypting and decrypting secrets by using ASP.NET Core Data Protection API, which can be used on Windows, Linux and macOS based Systems.
This project is written in C# and targets Microsoft .NET Framework 6.0 (LTS). 

*This will be useful for protecting sensitive application configuration settings that are stored directly on a Windows/Linux/macOS Server when a Secrets Manager solution is not in use.
