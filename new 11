NSSC Connection Method for NEHR @ Equinix

Option 1: Using OnPrem Logs Forwarder and GCC Logs Aggregator to send NEHR logs to GCSOC
Step 1 - On Prem "Logs Forwarder" forwards NEHR logs to GCC "Logs Aggregator" using SysLog protocol or equivalent over the Site-to-Site VPN.
Step 2 - NEHR logs payload gets routed to AWS Network Firewall for inspection
Step 3 - Inpsected NEHR logs payload gets routed to Ingress Network Load Balancer
Step 4.1a - Network Load Balancer route the traffic to the GCC "Logs Aggregator" EC2 Instances.
Step 4.1b - "Logs Aggregator" EC2 Instances uses Unified Cloudwatch Agent to forward the aggregated NEHR Logs to NEHR Cloud Watch Custom Log Groups
Steps 5&6 - GCC 2.0 Kinesis Data Firehose pipes the logs in NEHR Cloud Watch Custom Log Groups to GCCI Central Logs Repository
Step 7 - GCSOC picks up NEHR Logs stored at GCCI Central Logs Repository

Option 2: Using Unified Cloud Watch Agent installed on OnPrem Servers to send NEHR logs to GCSOC
Step 1 - The Unified Cloud Watch Agent on NEHR OnPrem Servers are configured to send the logs to Cloud Watch VPC Endpoint in GCC. Logs are sent over the Site-to-Site VPN to GCC.
Step 2 - The NEHR logs payload gets routed to AWS Network Firewall for inspection
Step 3 - Inpsected NEHR logs payload gets routed to Ingress Network Load Balancer
Step 4.2 - Network Load Balancer route the traffic to the CloudWatch VPN Endpoint.
Steps 5&6 - GCC 2.0 Kinesis Data Firehose pipes the logs in NEHR Cloud Watch Custom Log Groups to GCCI Central Logs Repository
Step 7 - GCSOC picks up NEHR Logs stored at GCCI Central Logs Repository
