Background
==========
This repository was forked from https://github.com/gpgme-sharp/gpgme-sharp

Adapted the original [PgpCombinedCrypto](Examples/PgpCombinedCrypto) project to provide a developer's guide for implementing OpenPGP (ie. using gpgme) for MOH and MOH's partners. Target Microsoft .NET Framework 6.0 (LTS) to support Applications that are developed for Windows, Linux and macOS.

Omited those VS.Net projects that are irrelevant in our context for brevity reasons.

gpgme-sharp
===========

gpgme-sharp is a C# wrapper around [GPGME](https://wiki.gnupg.org/APIs), the recommended way to use GnuPG within an application. It supports .NET Framework 4.0 and higher, and [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) 2.0 (including .NET Core 2.0).

[![NuGet version](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/gpgme-sharp.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/gpgme-sharp/)&nbsp;

Requirements
============

- On Windows, you will need to install [Gpg4Win](https://www.gpg4win.org). 
- On Debian and Ubuntu, install the [libgpgme11 package](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/libgpgme11).
- On other Linux distros or other operating systems, install libgpgme using your favourite package manager, or compile it from source. 

Note that Gpg4Win currently only distributes a 32-bit build, so on Windows you **must** set your C# app to run in 32-bit mode.

Usage
=====

The library can be installed using NuGet:
```
dotnet add package gpgme-sharp
```

See the [Examples](Examples/) directory in this repo for usage examples.

Catalog of VS.Net Projects in this Implementation Guide Repo.
======================================================
1. [PgpCombinedCrypto](Examples/PgpCombinedCrypto) provides the sample code as part of the developer's guide for MOH and MOH's partners to implement GnuPG. 

    a. Ready-to-Use Source Code for most applications
  
    - Thanks to .NET 6.0 framework, the provided source code will be suitable to implement the recommended way to use GnuPG within an application built for Windows, Linux and macOS Operating Systems. It can also be adopted to build AWS Lambda Functions and Azure Functions.

    b. Ready-to-Use Solutions for protecting the confidentiality of OpenPGP Private Keysâ€™ Secret Passphrases.
The provided source code provides 3 ready-to-use solutions that provides protection for the confidentiality of the secret passphrase for the OpenPGP private keys.

    - Solution 1: Uses AWS Secrets Manager [Recommended for AWS serverless and containerized based solutions. Also useful for Applications hosted on AWS EC2 Instances.]

    - Solution 2: Uses Windows Data Protection API [Only works for Systems developed for Windows OS. Optimized for Windows-Based Applications!]
    
    - Solution 3: Uses ASP.NET Core Data Protection API [Works for Windows, Linux and macOS based Applications. Can be used on any .NET core applications, including non-ASP.NET ones. Recommended for all other types of Applications that cannot use Solutions 1 & 2.

2. [ProtectSecretsWithWindowsDataProtectionAPI](ProtectSecretsWithWindowsDataProtectionAPI) provides a console program and a reusable code library for encrypting secrets by using Windows Data Protection API. This code can only be run on Windows Systems.

3. [ProtectSecretsWithASPNETCoreDataProtectionAPI](ProtectSecretsWithASPNETCoreDataProtectionAPI) provides a console program and a reusable code library for encrypting secrets by using ASP.NET Core Data Protection API. This code can be used on Windows, Linux and macOS Systems.

4. [DataBufferTest](Examples/DataBufferSamples/DataBufferTest) provides sample code on howto use gpgme-sharp's data buffers to handle the encrypted/decrypted data payloads without saving them  onto the OS filesystems. This is suitable for reading/writing the data from/to databases or object stores. This code can be used on Windows, Linux and macOS Systems.
