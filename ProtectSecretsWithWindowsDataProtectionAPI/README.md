Intro
=====
This project provides a console program and a reusable code library for encrypting and decrypting secrets by using Windows Data Protection API, which can only be used on Windows Systems.
This project is written in C# and targets Microsoft .NET Framework 6.0 (LTS). 

*This will be useful for protecting sensitive application configuration settings that are stored directly on a Windows Server when a Secrets Manager solution is not in use.
